# SOS-counterexample
Matrices and code for verifying nonnegativity of H_44 - H_521

For example, opening up a project in https://cocalc.com/, you can upload the two matrix files "counterexample-A.sobj" and "counterexample-P.sobj" to your main project folder. Then you can execute the SAGE worksheet "verify-certificate.sagews", which loads these matrices, and then performs computations with them.

For example, you may wish to see the explicit sums of squares decomposition of the symmetric polynomial H_44 - H_521. You could print this out term-by-term.
